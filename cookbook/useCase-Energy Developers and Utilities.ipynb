    "This Notebook leverages the **Processors** configured on **[Retab](https://www.retab.com/)** to process Energy Developers and Utilities Projects' Packages (like Contracts, Permits, Right-Of-Way, Invoices, Calendars, etc.) with high accuracy and reliability, based on an extraction schema defined and optimized on the platform.\n",
    "\n",
    "These Packages include various documents:\n",
    "- Energy contracts (Power Purchase Agreement, Gas Supply Contract, etc.)\n",
    "- Reports (Consumption / generation reports, smart meter data, etc.)\n",
    "- Invoices (Utility bills, supplier invoices, settlement invoices, etc.)\n",
    "- Regulatory documents (ROW, Compliance filings, licenses, permits, audit docs, etc.)\n",
    "- Technical reports (Maintenance logs, inspection reports, engineering reports, etc.)\n",
    "- Environmental reports (Sustainability, CO₂ emissions, impact studies, etc.)\n",
    "- Many more\n",
